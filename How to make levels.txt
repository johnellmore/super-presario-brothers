To make your own levels for Super Presario Brothers, open up a text editor like Notepad. Save this file to the "levels" subfolder as level{N}.lvl, where {N} is the first number not already taken.

Now you can start making your level. I'd recommend taking a look at a pre-existing level file to get an idea of how they work. "level1.lvl" is a good example.

Level files are laid out in a grid, with exactly 14 rows and an arbitrary number of columns. Trailing spaces at the end of each row can be optionally omitted, but your level will be as long as your longest row is.

The following symbols can be used:

P
This represents the player's inital location. There should only be one of these, but if there are multiple ones, the last one in the file will be used.

S
These are stars that the player must pick up in order to win the level

{space}
These represents air. The player can pass through this.

G
These are ground tiles. They should be used for the player to walk on. They should always be at the bottom of the screen, and never floating in the air.

B
These are floating platforms for the user to walk on. They should only be used in the air, and not on the ground.

C
These are blocks that sit stacked on the ground. Generally speaking, they shouldn't be floating, but they can be stacked as high as necessary.

J
This is a spring which launches the player higher than they could normally jump.

M
These are mines. They can be placed anywhere. The player will die if they make contact with these.

X
These are invisible death traps. They will kill the player on contact. Their primary purpose is to line the bottom of pits so that the player will not keep falling off the screen, but they are optional as the player will die anyway if they fall off the bottom.
